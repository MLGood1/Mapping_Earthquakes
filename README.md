# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview

As a data visualization specialist, working for Disaster Reporting Network, I have been tasked with creating an interactive geographical map to display
earthquake and tectonic plate data.  Each earthquake is visually represented by a colored circle, with the earthquakes with a higher magnitude having a larger diameter.  Each circle, also has a popup marker to display the magnitude and location of the earthquake.
